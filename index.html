<!--I just hope my 6th grade social studies teacher doesn't see this website, and if she does, hello there~
Her favorite color was purple, and she was VERY vocal about it. A couple of times she jokingly bullied me for liking the color blue.
Also weird story, sometime after high school I'm PRETTY sure I walked right past her while I was out, but never confirmed it was her.
I was wearing my favorite blue jacket, and I heard a voice say "wow, no purple".
I didn't stop to look or even talk to her; I was far too focused on getting home. I hope she didn't take it as me being rude or ignoring her.
It might make her happy to know that my second favorite color is, in fact, purple! Regardless of such, I hope she's okay now.
Also if you're reading this, I hope you're doing alright! Don't be afriad to take breaks when needed, and make sure you're drinking appropriate
amounts of water!-->
